Represent Neo4j graph data as YAML.


Features
--------

* Creates nodes and relationships in a Neo4j graph database from YAML using
  PyYAML-specific tags.
* Operates at a whole-file level, as it uses custom YAML tags to deserialize
  the data to live objects.
* Developed for loading data for integration testing.
* Requires a running Neo4j instance and instantiates actual database entities,
  rather than just generating abstract/unbound ``py2neo.Node`` and
  ``py2neo.Relationship`` objects. This is due to ``py2neo`` version
  1.6 not supporting node labels with abstract nodes. This might be changed if
  we are able to migrate off of 1.6 in the near future.

Versions
--------

Python
    Tested with both Python 2.7 and 3.5.
Neo4j
    Should work with anything >= 2.0 but < 3. Tested with 2.3.2. Running the
    tests requires 2.3 as it uses the ``DETACH DELETE`` feature to drop the
    database.
``py2neo``
    Currently only supports 2.0. Expecting to do 3; dreading 1.6.
``pyyaml``
    Only tested with PyYAML v3.11, the last release since 2014.

Testing
-------

Running the tests requires an installed, running Neo4j instance. Pass the URL
through the environment variable ``NEO4J_URI``.

Future
------

* Make nodes just dicts with 'labels' and 'properties' keys. Maybe make rels
  dicts with 'head', 'tail', 'type' and 'properties' keys too?
* Make it easier to load without creating in the database?
* Custom YAML representer & constructor. Currently it is not possible to
  automatically dump Node and Relationship objects in a reasonable fashion.
* ``py2neo`` & Neo4j v3 support.
* Documentation, etc.
